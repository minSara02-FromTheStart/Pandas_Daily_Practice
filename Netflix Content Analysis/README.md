# Netflix Content Analysis

This is a small project where I explored a mini Netflix dataset to see what kind of content is on the platform.  
I used **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to answer simple questions and make some charts.

## What I Did

- Checked how many **Movies** vs **TV Shows** there are.  
- Found out the **most common genres**.  
- Looked at the **top countries** producing content.  
- Checked **content ratings** (PG, R, TV-MA, etc.).  
- Saw how the number of titles released changed over the years.
